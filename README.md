Steps on how to create GitHub Page: 
If you have a github classroom, you should push your html and css code there.

What are my key takeaways from this exercise?
I had a lot of trial and errors for using different elements.
I had trouble with customizing elements especially with flexbox.
I found a website that visualizes the different flexbox layouts and it helped me a lot.
I think coding more and practicing the different elements here would make me
more confident in creating pages.
